     * Should return a composite flag which defines the enabled move directions in each state

     * <p>
     * Instead of composing this flag manually, you can use {@link #makeMovementFlags(int,
     * int)}
     * or {@link #makeFlag(int, int)}.
     * <p>
     * This flag is composed of 3 sets of 8 bits, where first 8 bits are for IDLE state, next
     * 8 bits are for SWIPE state and third 8 bits are for DRAG state.
     * Each 8 bit sections can be constructed by simply OR'ing direction flags defined in
     * {@link ItemTouchHelper}.
     * <p>
     * For example, if you want it to allow swiping LEFT and RIGHT but only allow starting to
     * swipe by swiping RIGHT, you can return:
     * <pre>
     *      makeFlag(ACTION_STATE_IDLE, RIGHT) | makeFlag(ACTION_STATE_SWIPE, LEFT | RIGHT);
     * </pre>
     * This means, allow right movement while IDLE and allow right and left movement while
     * swiping.
